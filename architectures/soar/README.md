## SOAR

The SOAR architecture (Laird, 1984) is a cognitive architecture designed to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving processes. 

 SOAR models and simulates human cognition, including problem-solving, decision-making, learning, and memory. It stands for "State, Operator, And Result" reflecting its fundamental components:
 * **State**: SOAR maintains an internal representation of the current state of the problem or task. This state consists of a set of working memory elements that encode information about the world, goals, and current intentions;

* **Operator**: Operators are rules or procedures that represent potential actions or steps to achieve goals or modify the current state. Operators are encoded in productions, which are conditional statements specifying when to execute a particular operator;

* **Result**: The resulting phase involves the execution of selected operators to modify the state. The system evaluates and selects the most appropriate operator based on its knowledge and the current state.
