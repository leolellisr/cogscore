## Pioneer

The robot Pioneer P3DX has 2 independent motors, one for each wheel, and 16 proximity sensors, 8 on its front arranged in 180 degrees and the other 8 on the rear also arranged in 180 degrees. These sensors rely on ultrasonic propagation to produce data. 

The robot also has a laser sensor. This sensor is described as a high-resolution collision-free sensor for collecting obstacle distance information.
