## Marta

The Marta humanoid robot, a 1.1 m tall female robot, was physically designed and built by our workgroup. 

Marta has 25 degrees of freedom, and her head can perform *pitch* and *yaw* movements. 

Marta is equipped with an RGB-D camera on her head, to inspect the world in three distinct channels of color (R, G and B) and distance information (D).
